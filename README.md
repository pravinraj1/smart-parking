# Real-Time Parking Space Monitoring and Mobile App Integration

## Project Overview

This project aims to design and implement a real-time parking space monitoring system integrated with a mobile app for efficient parking guidance. The solution involves the deployment of IoT sensors in parking spaces to detect occupancy and availability, and the development of a mobile app to provide users with real-time parking information and navigation guidance.
